\section{Conclusion}

WahooML will aid data scientists by expediting the model building process. The
system will allow users to quickly test hypotheses about optimal models via its
batch training and model database features. My research will contribute several
core optimizations to the system, allowing WahooML to support incremental
training, batched k-folds cross-validation, and optimal ensemble model-finding.
This proposal discussed the design of each optimization and how each will fit
into the overall system.
