\section{Benchmarks}

We intend to evaluate the results and performance of our system using
several open-source datasets. Websites that host these datasets include
Kaggle and various university sites. We will evaluate the performance
of WahooML by two main metrics: accuracy of the resulting model and
the computation time taken to derive that model. So, we will need to
roughly approximate the time needed to manually derive the optimal model
via iterative training, and then compare this time to WahooML.
