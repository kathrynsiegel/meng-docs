Existing machine learning tools allow data scientists to iteratively engineer
features and train models. Much of a data scientist's time is spent determining
the optimal model by tweaking dozens of inputs. WahooML is a data scientist
productivity tool that expedites the process for discovering optimal models.
The system optimizes the entire model development process by allowing data
scientists to train sets of models, taking advantage of the parallels between
models and storing trained models in an external database. My research will
focus on several significant optimization components of WahooML: incremental
training, k-folds cross validation, and ensemble models.
