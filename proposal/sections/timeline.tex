\section{Timeline}

My past and intended timeline for completing the work required for my Master's
thesis is comprised of the following deadlines. Note that these deadlines are
heavily based off of the WahooML team's development deadlines. 

\begin{enumerate}[topsep=0pt,itemsep=-1ex,partopsep=1ex,parsep=1ex]

\item (Done) End of September - Conduct literature survey, familiarize myself
with existing tools, set up Spark.

\item (Done) Mid-October - Complete interfaces for project.

\item (Done) Beginning of November - Demoable MVP with model storage in an
external database.

\item (Done) Thanksgiving - Scope out individual work for the optimizer component of
WahooML, finish Master's thesis proposal, complete design documents for
training optimizations, and iterate on MVP implementation.

\item End of Semester - Implement optimizations for incremental data and
incremental training iterations. Also implement the K-folds optimization.

\item End of IAP - Improve optimizations from November-December sprint,
research ensemble models.

\item Spring Break (end of March) - Complete WahooML component optimizing
ensemble models.

\item Mid-April - Wrap up work on system optimizations.

\item Mid-May - Finish Thesis
