This thesis presents a series of implementations of incremental random forests in Spark. My work draws from existing methods in online learning literature, but include several novel techniques. Through analysis of the performance of these implementations on varying workloads, I determine that tree regeneration is the best singular strategy for augmenting an existing random forest given an additional batch of training data. I also evaluate many hybrid strategies and show that regrowing a small proportion of trees is the best combined strategy with regards to time and performance. My results indicate that incremental growth strategies for online random forests are not useful for batched workflows. Overall, the system demonstrates significant performance gains when compared to the standard method of regrowing the random forest.
